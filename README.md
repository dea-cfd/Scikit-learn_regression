# Scikit-learn_regression
Bayesian and Gaussian Process regression using scikit-learn libraries for a simple test

This repository describe a bayesian and gaussian process regression using scikit-learn libraries 
for a simple test with 2 features (pressure (Pa), velocity (m/s)) 
and the target is the shear (dudz=f(p,v))..... 
In this repository : reg2d.py -> python code, 
                    database base0.txt, 
                    also scriptChD.sh to run multiple cases 
                    and plot.gp to plot the results.

Here is an example:
